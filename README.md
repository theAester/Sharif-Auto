Sharif Auto chrome extention version 0.3(beta)

Description:
CW sucks soooooo hard that i had to try and patch some of the things that the original programmers shouldve thought of myself using an extention(which gives me 1/10 of the features those fuckers in the frontend(and backend) team had and is a complete pain in the ass).
Anyway here it is and I hope yall enjoy it.

Forking and improving the extention is welcome(and somewhat neccessary given that i have a fat fucking ass and no taste) so hit me up and i may even add you as a contributor.

Thank you.
Bye.

P.S.: if you're thinking of giving me advice over clean-code and readability go fuck yourself.
