# Sharif Auto chrome extension version 0.3(BETA)
It's still being developed so rn it basically has too few features.

## Description:
 CW sucks soooooo hard that i had to try and patch some of the things that the original programmers shouldve thought of in the first place myself using an extension(which gives me 1/10 of the features those fuckers in the frontend(and backend) team had and is a complete pain in the ass(and is slow as fuck)).
 
Anyway here it is and I hope yall enjoy it.

## Features
* It saves your username and password and automates log ins(since the CW programmers decided its cool to just log you out every hour and redirect you twice in order to get you back on track). Those of you with a wide and impatient ass will love it
* It replaces that {$a} bullshit with the actual name of the event on the front page(THIS COULD BE FIXED BY THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPERS BY CHANGING A SINGLE QUOTATION TO A DOUBLE QUOTATION IN LIKE 4 LINES OF CODE!!! but i don't have access to the backend so i have to inject JAVASCRIPT into the page and wait for the WHOLE THING to load TWICE to snatch a single title from the document. Brilliant(and yes it takes ages but its better than a {$a} saying fuck you to your face every time)
## Notes
Forking and improving the extension is encouraged(and somewhat neccessary given that i have a fat fucking ass and no taste) so hit me up and i may even add you as a contributor.

Thank you.

Bye.

P.S.: if you're even thinking of giving me advice over clean-code and readability go fuck yourself.
## How To Use
JUST LOOK AT IT MAN IT EXPLAINS ITSELF
## Installation
Since google wants to be an asshole i cant put this up on the official extension store(unless one of yall is willing to pay $5) 

so you gotta install it from source:

1. download all these files in your preferred folder(it has to be an exclusive folder ofc) say ~/Desktop/myshittyextension
2. then you go to chrome and type in
``chrome://extensions``
in the url bar
3. Then you click the little dangly thing on the upper right that says _'Developer mode'_
4. Then you click on the _'Load Unpacked'_ button and navigate to that ~/Desktop/myshittyextension folder of yours.
 5. It's ready to use no need to restart or reload or pray or whatever. Nothing. Done. Honestly I can say its the one of the easiest thing you can do using your fingers and your brain idek why tf i wrote five steps for it I mean man HAVE YOU EVER TRIED INSTALLING ISE AND PROTEUS ON LINUX?? like these old ass simulators just MEAN to hurt your soul man i say these motherfuckers are MADE FOR windows and still it takes operational computer engineering skills to make them work on windows itself and here i am writing a step-by-step guide for yall dumbasses to install this shit fuck just fucking do it man why do I have to do the documentations?
6. I'm high

## TODO
* fix the other {$a} too
* get some bitches
